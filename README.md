User profiles with basic info (name, email, preferences, etc.).

2. Tinder-like Swiping Interface
Card-based UI: Each clothing item appears as a swipeable card (like Tinder).

Swipe Actions:

Right Swipe (Like): User expresses interest in the item.

Left Swipe (Reject): User skips the item.

Double-tap/Click for Details: Users can click on a card to view more details (fabric, size, condition, brand, etc.).

3. Matching System
If User A likes User B’s clothing item AND User B also likes User A’s item → Match!

Once matched:

Users can chat to discuss exchange logistics (shipping/local meetup).

Option to confirm exchange (mark as completed).

4. Product Upload & Moderation
Users can upload clothing items with:

High-quality images.

Descriptions (size, brand, condition, color, material, etc.).

Admin Approval System:

Before an item goes live, an admin must verify:

Image quality (no scams/fake uploads).

Appropriate content (no prohibited items).

Approved items appear in the swiping feed; rejected items are removed.

5. Additional Features
Wishlist/Preferences: Users can set clothing preferences (e.g., size, style).

Notifications: Alerts for matches, messages, and admin approvals.

Exchange History: Track past exchanges.

Rating System: Users can rate each other after successful exchanges.

6. Tech Stack Suggestions (Optional)
Frontend: React.js (for smooth swiping animations) or Flutter.

Backend: Node.js + Express or Django.

Database: Firebase (for real-time updates) or PostgreSQL.

Image Storage: Cloudinary or AWS S3.

Matching Logic: Socket.io for real-time matching.

Expected UI/UX Flow:
User signs up/logs in → Redirected to the swiping feed.

Swipes left/right on clothing items.

Clicks on a card to see detailed info.

Gets a match when mutual interest → Opens chat.

Uploads an item → Waits for admin approval before it goes live.

Final Deliverables Needed:
 A fully functional web app with:

Tinder-like swipe mechanics.

Secure user auth (login/registration).

Admin dashboard for content moderation.

Real-time matching & chat.
 Mobile-responsive design (optional: Progressive Web App for mobile feel).
